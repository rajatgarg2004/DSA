Comparison between insertion and bubble sort. 
1. On the basis of number of comparisons :  Both require equal number of comparsions.

2. On the basis of ROF swaps :  More swaps are required for bubble sort.

3. As both bubble sort and selection sort are In-place algorithms, therefore both of their Inplace Algorithms have been written above.
